## Ugly images for testing

As a developer, I've worked with many programming languages over the years. Here are a few of my favorites:

## Python

Python is a versatile language that can be used for everything from web development to data analysis. It has a clean syntax and a large community of developers, which makes it easy to find help and resources online.

## JavaScript

JavaScript is the language of the web, and it's used to create dynamic and interactive websites. It's also used on the server-side with Node.js, which makes it a versatile language for full-stack development.
